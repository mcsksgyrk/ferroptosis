# ferroptosis
## To Do (human pr producst)
- [x] KEGG to Psimi
- [x] FerrDB to Psimi
    - [] BUG: there are some nd molecule type (from ferrdb could not decide what is that with mprotein and kegg compounds)
- [x] FerReg to Psimi
    - BUG: rnas calssified as protein type
- [x] Merge databses

- [] compounds from kegg and from rest different ids -> probably duplicates
- [] compounds and small molecules nomencalture has to be more cleaner

- [x] Omnipath integration
