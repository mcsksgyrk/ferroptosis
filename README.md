# ferroptosis
## To Do (human pr producst)
- [x] KEGG to Psimi
- [x] FerrDB to Psimi
- [x] FerReg to Psimi
- [x] Merge databses

- [] compounds from kegg and from rest different ids -> probably duplicates
- [] compounds and small molecules nomencalture has to be more cleaner
    - [] have to decide the default primary id type

- [x] Omnipath integration
- [x] Statistics
- Bugs:
    - [x] there are some nd molecule type (from ferrdb could not decide what is that with mprotein and kegg compounds)
    - [x] rnas calssified as protein type
    - [x] some entries has uniprot\_d primary id type, but id value is not uniprot
